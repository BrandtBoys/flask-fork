Saves a session cookie to the client's browser.

This method sets a session cookie based on the provided `app`, `session`, and `response` objects.
It determines the necessary cookie attributes (name, domain, path, secure, samesite, httponly) using
the `get_cookie_name`, `get_cookie_domain`, `get_cookie_path`, `get_cookie_secure`, 
`get_cookie_samesite`, and `get_cookie_httponly` methods.

If the session was accessed at all, it adds a ""Vary: Cookie"" header to the response.
If the session is empty or modified to be empty, it removes the cookie from the response.
Otherwise, it sets the cookie with the determined attributes and adds a ""Vary: Cookie"" header.

Parameters:
app (Flask): The Flask application instance.
session (SessionMixin): The session object being saved.
response (Response): The HTTP response object.

Returns:
