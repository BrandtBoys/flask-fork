Defaults to None.\n- as_attachment (bool): Whether to send the file as an attachment. Defaults to False.\n- download_name (str | None): The name of the downloaded file. Defaults to None.\n- conditional (bool): Whether to check for a conditional GET request. Defaults to True.\n- etag (bool | str): Whether to include the ETag in the response headers or its value as a string. Defaults to True.\n- last_modified (datetime | int | float | None): The last modified date of the file. Defaults to None.\n- max_age (None | (int | t.Callable[[str | None], int | None])): The maximum age of the cached response in seconds.

"(False, '""""""\nStream a generator or function with context.\n\nThis function takes an iterator or callable that returns an iterator, and wraps it in a context manager. The context manager pushes the current request context onto the stack when the generator is started, and pops it off when the iteration completes.\n\nIf the input is not an iterator, but rather a callable that returns an iterator, this function will wrap the callable in a decorator to create a new function that takes any arguments and returns the wrapped iterator. The `update_wrapper` function is used to preserve the original function\'s name and docstring.\n\nThe context manager uses the `_cv_request.get(None)` method to retrieve the current request context. If no context is available, it raises a RuntimeError.\n\nThis function can only be used when a request context is active, such as in a view function.\n\nArgs:\n    generator_or_function: An iterator or callable that returns an iterator.\n\nReturns:\n    An iterator over the wrapped generator or function.\n""""""\n```')"
