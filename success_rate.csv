Returns the value of the requested attribute, or raises an AttributeError if it does not exist.

The function is used to handle special attributes that are deprecated and will be removed in future versions of Flask.
It provides a way to access these attributes while still raising a warning about their deprecation.

Attributes:
    - `_app_ctx_stack`: The application context stack. (Deprecated)
    - `_request_ctx_stack`: The request context stack. (Deprecated)
    - `escape`: A function for escaping HTML characters. (Deprecated, use markupsafe.escape instead)
    - `Markup`: A class for representing unescaped HTML. (Deprecated, use markupsafe.Markup instead)
    - `signals_available`: Always returns True, as signals are always available.

Raises:
    AttributeError: If the requested attribute does not exist.

    Creates a response object from the given view function result.

    The response object is created based on the type of the view function result.
    If the result is a tuple, it is unpacked into body, status, and headers.
    If the result is None, a TypeError is raised.
    If the result is not an instance of the response class, it is converted to
    the correct type.

    Args:
        rv: The view function result.

    Returns:
        A Response object.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the view function did not return a valid response tuple,
            or if the result is None.

Saves a session cookie to the client's browser.

This method sets a session cookie based on the provided `app`, `session`, and `response` objects.
It determines the necessary cookie attributes (name, domain, path, secure, samesite, httponly) using
the `get_cookie_name`, `get_cookie_domain`, `get_cookie_path`, `get_cookie_secure`, 
`get_cookie_samesite`, and `get_cookie_httponly` methods.

If the session was accessed at all, it adds a ""Vary: Cookie"" header to the response.
If the session is empty or modified to be empty, it removes the cookie from the response.
Otherwise, it sets the cookie with the determined attributes and adds a ""Vary: Cookie"" header.

Parameters:
app (Flask): The Flask application instance.
session (SessionMixin): The session object being saved.
response (Response): The HTTP response object.

Returns:
None

Test session vary cookie functionality.

This function tests the behavior of Flask's session object when
varying headers. It checks that the 'Vary' header is set correctly
for different routes and scenarios.

Parameters:
app (Flask application): The Flask application instance.
client (requests Session): The requests client instance.

Returns:
None

Tests:

- /set: Tests setting a value in the session and verifying the 'Vary'
  header is not set.
- /get: Tests getting a value from the session and verifying the 'Vary'
  header is not set.
- /getitem: Tests getting a value from the session using indexing and
  verifying the 'Vary' header is not set.
- /setdefault: Tests setting a default value in the session and verifying
  the 'Vary' header is not set.
- /clear: Tests clearing the session and verifying the 'Vary' header is
  not set.
- /vary-cookie-header-set: Tests varying the 'Cookie' header when setting
  a value in the session.
- /vary-header-set: Tests varying multiple headers when setting a value
  in the session.
- /no-vary-header: Tests that no 'Vary' header is set for this route.

Note:
The `expect` function is used to test each route. It sends a GET request
to the specified path and verifies the 'Vary' header is set correctly.
If the expected value is not provided, it checks that the 'Vary' header
is not present at all.
"""""""

Clears the Flask session.

This function uses the `flask.session.clear()` method to remove all items from the current session. It returns an empty string, indicating that no data was cleared.

Args:
    None

Returns:
    str: An empty string indicating success
"""""""

Tests the behavior of session refresh with the Vary header.

This test suite verifies that when a user navigates to a login page and then
refreshes their session, the server responds with a Vary: Cookie header.
Additionally, it checks that this behavior is consistent even when navigating
to an ignored route.

Args:
    app (Flask application): The Flask application instance.
    client (TestClient): A TestClient instance for making HTTP requests.

Returns:
    None

Raises:
    AssertionError: If the Vary header does not match the expected value.

Login Function.

This function sets the user ID in the session to 1 and makes the session permanent.
 
Parameters:

Returns:
An empty string indicating successful login.
 
Raises:

Notes:
This function is a placeholder for actual authentication logic. It should be replaced with a secure method of verifying user credentials.

path (str): The root path of the application. Defaults to ""/"".
base_url (Optional[str]): The base URL of the application. If provided, subdomain and url_scheme cannot be used. Defaults to None.
subdomain (Optional[str]): The subdomain of the application. If provided with a base_url, it will override the base_url. Defaults to None.
url_scheme (Optional[str]): The scheme of the URL. If not provided, it will use the preferred scheme from the Flask configuration. Defaults to None.

Returns:
None

Yields a new session object for the given test request context.

This function is used to create and manage sessions in a test environment.
It handles the creation of cookies and updates them based on the response headers.

Opens a new test request.

This method is used to create a new test request, which can be used to simulate HTTP requests and responses.
It takes several keyword arguments that control the behavior of the request:

- `buffered`: If True, the response will be buffered. Otherwise, it will be sent immediately.
- `follow_redirects`: If True, redirects will be followed.

If no request is provided, one will be created from the given arguments and keyword arguments.

Returns:
    TestResponse: The response object for the test request.

    Enters the context of a Flask client.

    This method is used to create a new context for the Flask client. It sets the `preserve_context` attribute to `True`, 
    indicating that subsequent invocations will preserve the current context. If an attempt is made to nest client invocations, 
    a RuntimeError is raised.

    Returns:
        The instance of the FlaskClient class, allowing for method chaining.
    
    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If an attempt is made to nest client invocations.

Closes the context stack and sets preserve_context to False.

This method is called when the exception handling context is exited. It ensures that the context is properly cleaned up by closing the context stack, which helps prevent resource leaks. The `preserve_context` flag is also set to False to indicate that the current context should not be preserved for future use.

Args:
    exc_type (type): The type of the exception that was raised.
    exc_value (BaseException): The value of the exception that was raised.
    tb (TracebackType): The traceback object associated with the exception.
