Creates a new Flask application instance.

This function initializes a new Flask application, adds two URL rules,
and returns the configured application instance.

Args:

Tests that invoking the 'routes' command with no routes registered returns a success exit code and an output indicating so.

Args:

Tests the functionality of the test_subdomain method.

This function tests the creation and invocation of a Flask application with subdomains.
It creates two routes, ""/a"" and ""/b"", each with its own subdomain, and then invokes the `routes` command using the `cli` object.
The function asserts that the exit code is 0 (indicating success) and that the output contains the string ""Subdomain"".

Parameters:
    self: The test case instance.

Returns:
    None
"""""""
True,"""""""
Tests the functionality of the test_host method.

This function tests the creation and invocation of a Flask application with multiple routes.
It verifies that the application is created successfully and that the 'routes' command can be invoked without errors.

Parameters:
self (object): The instance of the class being tested.

Returns:
None
"""""""

Aborts the application with a given error code.

This function is used to terminate the application and return an error response.
It takes in an optional `code` parameter which specifies the error code,
as well as any additional arguments that may be required for the abort process.

Args:
    - code (int | BaseResponse): The error code to use for the abort.
    - *args: Additional positional arguments.
    - **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

Returns:
    None

Raises:
    NoReturn: If the application is not currently running, this function will raise a NoReturn exception.

Raises a RuntimeError indicating that the session is unavailable due to an unconfigured secret key.

Args:
    *args: Variable length argument list.
    **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

Returns:
    None, as this function does not return any value. Instead, it raises a RuntimeError with a descriptive error message.

Raises:
    RuntimeError: If the session is unavailable because no secret key was set.
"""""""

Returns the value of a deprecated attribute.

If the requested attribute is `_app_ctx_stack` or `_request_ctx_stack`, it returns its value and issues a deprecation warning. Otherwise, it raises an `AttributeError`.

Args:
    name (str): The name of the attribute to return.

Raises:
    AttributeError: If the attribute does not exist.
    DeprecationWarning: If the requested attribute is deprecated.

Returns:
    object: The value of the requested attribute or None if it does not exist.
