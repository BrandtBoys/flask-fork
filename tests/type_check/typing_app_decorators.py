@a"""
Teardowns synchronization operations after an exception occurs.

This function is designed to be used as part of a larger error handling mechanism.
It takes an exception object as input and performs any necessary cleanup or rollback
of the synchronization operation before continuing execution. If no exception occurred,
it does nothing.

Parameters:
exc (BaseException | None): The exception that occurred, or None if no exception occurred.

Returns:
None: This function does not return a value.

"""
Teardowns an asynchronous operation.

This function is used to handle exceptions that occur during an asynchronous operation.
It provides a way to clean up resources and restore the original state of the system
after an exception has occurred.

Args:
    exc (BaseException | None): The exception that occurred during the operation. Can be None if no exception occurred.

Returns:
    None

Raises:
    BaseException: If an error occurs while cleaning up resources.
